## Description

The Barker application allows users to input up to three dog traits from a drop down list. This then populates another dropdown with dog breeds matching the selected traits. Once the user selects the desired breed a picture populates of the selected breed. A list of information shows below the picture including: Breed name, weight, height, what they were originally bred for, breed group, lifespan and ttemperament. The user can then input their zip code to display the closest PetSmart location, with address, City, and clickable phone number displayed. The zip codes the user inputs are saved to local storage and then display on the page as a clickable button that once again populates the petstore information.
